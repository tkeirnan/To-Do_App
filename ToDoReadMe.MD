# Tommy Keirnan's To Do App

Using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript, Tommy was able to create a To-do application that allows the user to generate their own to-do list.  When the user wants to add an item to his list, he simply types text into the text input box and then press the Enter key. This will cause the text to appear in the list section of the application. To the right of the new list item, two buttons will allow the user to mark the to-do item as completed, or delete the item altogether. A user could mark an item as completed to remember that he has already completed that item.
